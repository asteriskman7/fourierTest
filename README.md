# fourierTest
Test of drawing an image with Fourier series.

A series of x,y coordinates (in this case, points forming a square wave) are passed through the descrete Fourier transform to get a set of frequency/amplitude/phase values and then the x,y coordinates are re-created by stepping through the sum of those values from 0 to 2 * PI.

This is also known as epicycles.
